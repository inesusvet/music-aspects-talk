## 10 parts
Let's imagine that we could split a developer's work into equal parts. Which
parts would it be?

+++
### ~Start with~ Notes
Seems like it's absolutely necessary to know how to read through the language
beforehand. But sometimes even "wrong code" is a better place than no code at all.

+++
### Articulation & Duration
We can express our ideas in a bunch of different ways and how to use different
approaches to get better results.

+++
### Dynamics
"How to use dynamics to connect with your audience"

+++
### Rhythm & Tempo

+++
### Tone

+++
### Phrasing
And the composition. Think about it. It combines different parts into one piece.
I believe that those parts and it's relations could be clearly outlined for
better harmony.

+++
### Space & Rest

+++
### Listening

+++
### Groove
How joyful developer's work can be?
How often it happens so?
What can lead to joyful workday?
