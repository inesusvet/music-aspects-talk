@title[10 things]
## 10 parts
Which parts would it be?

---
### Groove
> Why feel and emotion are important in music and an explanation of
the elements that need to be present for a good groove to happen

How joyful developer's work can be?
How often it happens so?
What can lead to joyful workday?

---
### Notes
> Sometimes even the _right_ notes can sound wrong.
But applying chromatic scales and playing within the musical context can make
“wrong” notes sound right.

Seems like it's absolutely necessary to know how to read through the language
beforehand. But sometimes even "wrong code" is a better place than no code at all.

### Articulation & Duration
> How changes in articulation can affect the feel and help create a more
professional sound.

We can express our ideas in a bunch of different ways and use different
approaches to get better results.

Object-oriented, functional, cooperate multitasking, multiprocessing etc

---
### Dynamics
"How to use dynamics to connect with your audience"

---
### Rhythm & Tempo
> Victor’s suggested rhythmic exercises along with the creative use
of metronomes and drum machines will improve a player’s sense of time.

---
### Tone
> Understanding the role of tone quality and how to adjust it for different situations.

---
### Phrasing
> Utilizing singing, breathing and imagination to create more natural, more musical phrases.

And the composition. Think about it. It combines different parts into one piece.
I believe that those parts and it's relations could be clearly outlined for
better harmony.

---
### Space & Rest
> A discussion and demonstration of why space is such an integral part of playing music.

---
### Listening
> Learning to trust your ears and why listening may well be the most essential aspect of playing music.
