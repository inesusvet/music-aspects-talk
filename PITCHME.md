@title[10 things]
## 10 parts
Which parts would it be?

---
### Notes

Seems like it's absolutely necessary to know how to read through the language
beforehand. But sometimes it's easier to understand something by playing with it.
Even "wrong code" is a better place than no code at all.

---
### Articulation & Duration

We can express our ideas in a bunch of different ways and use different
approaches to get better results.

Object-oriented paradigm, functional, declarative, parallel computing, event-driven etc

---
### Dynamics

Software project development has it's own phases and it's own ebbs & tides.
Also there are many researches on group dynamics related to teams.

---
### Tone

We could use only "right" data structures and algorithms to express our ideas.
But we see that "dirty way" shows good results too.

---
### Phrasing

Which parts we want to join into one piece? In which order?
I believe that those parts and it's relations could be clearly outlined for
better cohesion.

---
### Space & Rest
> A discussion and demonstration of why space is such an integral part of playing music.

Can you stop for a minute? For a day? Do you have slack time to come up with new ideas?

---
### Listening
> Learning to trust your ears and why listening may well be the most essential aspect of playing music.

Are you listening to you self and to your colleagues? Are you patient enough?
What have you learned from them? What can you give to them?
