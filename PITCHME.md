### Groove
> Why feel and emotion are important in music and an explanation of
the elements that need to be present for a good groove to happen

How joyful your work can be? Why it is important?
How often do you have such a joy? What can lead to truly joyful work day?

@title[10 things]
## 10 parts
Which parts would it be?

---
### Notes
> Sometimes even the _right_ notes can sound wrong.
But applying chromatic scales and playing within the musical context can make
“wrong” notes sound right.

Seems like it's absolutely necessary to know how to read through the language
beforehand. But sometimes even "wrong code" is a better place than no code at all.

### Articulation & Duration
> How changes in articulation can affect the feel and help create a more
professional sound.

We can express our ideas in a bunch of different ways and use different
approaches to get better results.

Object-oriented paradigm, functional, declarative, parallel computing, event-driven etc

---
### Dynamics
> How to use dynamics to connect with your audience

Software project development has it's own phases and it's own ebbs & tides.
Also there are many researches on group dynamics related to teams.

---
### Rhythm & Tempo
> How to improve a player’s sense of time by rhythmic exercises along with the
creative use of metronomes and drum machines.

---
### Tone
> Understanding the role of tone quality and how to adjust it for different situations.

---
### Phrasing
> Utilizing singing, breathing and imagination to create more natural, more musical phrases.

Which parts we want to join into one piece? In which order?
I believe that those parts and it's relations could be clearly outlined for
better harmony.

---
### Space & Rest
> A discussion and demonstration of why space is such an integral part of playing music.

Can you stop for a day? Do you have slack time to come up with new ideas?

---
### Listening
> Learning to trust your ears and why listening may well be the most essential aspect of playing music.

Are you listening to your colleagues? Are you patient enough?
What have you learned from them? What can you give?
